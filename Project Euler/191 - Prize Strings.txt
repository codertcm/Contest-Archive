Evaluate:

Total[{1,0,0,0,0,0}*{{1,1,0,1,0,0},{1,0,1,1,0,0},{1,0,0,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1,1,0},{0,0,0,1,0,1},{0,0,0,1,0,0}}^30]

Consider a finite state machine with 6 states corresponding to having 0, 1,
2 consecutive As and having or not used an L. Then it only remains to
compute the number of paths with length 30, by raising the adjacency
matrix of the state diagram to the 30th power and adding up the first row.
